## Description

Deforestation is the permanent removal of standing forests, which occurs for a variety of reasons and has many devastating consequences. The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for Indigenous people. In the last 13 years, more than 43 million hectares of forest have been devastated in the world, an area the size of California, USA. It is important to stop deforestation, as soon as possible, before the damage is irreversible. There are many ways to fight deforestation. This challenge will consist of using the help of thousands of satellites in space to capture images of the earth's surface in order to detect, as soon as possible, areas in the midst of deforestation and prevent its expansion.
